# AI Python Code Quality Analyzer 

This project analyzes Python code for complexity, linting, and provides heuristic AI suggestions.
It includes:
- Flask web app with login/register/history
- SQLite storage (users.db created on first run)
- Radon (complexity) and pylint (linting)
- Heuristic AI fallback (works without transformers/torch)
